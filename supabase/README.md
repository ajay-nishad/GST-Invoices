## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Invoice

```sql
-- 1. Create invoice
INSERT INTO invoices (user_id, business_id, customer_id, invoice_number)
VALUES (user_uuid, business_uuid, customer_uuid, generate_invoice_number(business_uuid));

-- 2. Add invoice items
INSERT INTO invoice_items (invoice_id, item_name, quantity, unit_price, taxable_amount, tax_rate, total_amount)
VALUES (invoice_uuid, 'Product Name', 1, 100.00, 100.00, 18.00, 118.00);

```

### Getting Dashboard Stats

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_dashboard_stats('user-uuid-here');
```

### Viewing Invoice Summary

```sql
SELECT * FROM invoice_summary
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here'
ORDER BY invoice_date DESC;
```

## TypeScript Integration

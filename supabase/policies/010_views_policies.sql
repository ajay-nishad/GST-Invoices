-- RLS Policies for views
-- Views inherit RLS from their underlying tables, but we can add additional policies if needed

-- Note: Views automatically inherit RLS policies from their underlying tables
-- The following views inherit policies from their base tables:
-- - invoice_summary: inherits from invoices, customers, businesses, users
-- - customer_summary: inherits from customers, users, businesses, invoices
-- - business_summary: inherits from businesses, users, customers, invoices, items
-- - monthly_revenue: inherits from users, invoices

-- Additional view-specific policies (if needed for complex views)
-- These are commented out as views inherit RLS from base tables

-- Example: If we had a view that needed special handling
-- CREATE POLICY "view_name_select_own" ON view_name
--     FOR SELECT 
--     USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Comments:
-- - Views automatically inherit RLS from underlying tables
-- - No additional policies needed for standard views
-- - Complex views may need custom policies
-- - All views respect user data isolation
-- - Guest users cannot access any view data
